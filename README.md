## Introduction
"I'm a mountain guy" - Khabib Nurmagomedov. Khabib Nurmagomedov, the longest reigning UFC lightweight champion credits his physicality and athleticism to his environment, saying that living and training in the mountains, was one of the reasons for his success. This sparked the start our analysis, to see whether the environmental factor of altitute really has an impact on an athletes success. And what better way to test this theory, than on the biggest sporting event in the world... The Olympics!

## Variables
MedalCount: Represents the number of medals (bronze, silver and gold) won by a Country from 1896 to 2016

Average Elevation: The mean elevation (altitude) of a country

Highest Point: The max elevation (altitude) of a country

Average_Population: Population averaged from 1960 to 2021

Average_GDP: GDP averaged from 1960 to 2021

## Hypothesis
As the Average Elevation or Highest Point of a country increases, the country's respective medal count in the olympics also increases.

This is because training in higher altitudes the body triggers a hormonal response that enhances the way oxygen is delivered and utilised throughout the body. Creating more blood vessels for oxygen to flow through, altitude training may lead to improved heart functionality, enhanced muscle performance and greater overall health. With more oxygen flowing through your body, recovery times are minimised while strength and endurance is enhanced. Morevoer, studies have also suggested a positive impact on stress reduction and sleep patterns, making altitude training a workout style that offers ongoing benefits.
